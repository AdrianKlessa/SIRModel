# SIRModel
A python script implementing a simple SIR model of disease spread. Uses numpy and matplotlib. 

I used the [Markov Models for Infectious Diseases](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/marcelo-perraillon/sites/default/files/attached-files/lecture_12_inf_model.pdf) lecture by Marcelo Coca Perraillon as a learning resource.

Parameters:

beta - the transmission rate of the disease (realistically a function of the rate of contact and probability of transmission given contact)
gamma - recovery rate of infected people

Example output:
